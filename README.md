[Project 1: Crime-Analyst-Project](https://github.com/TongtaiM/Crime-Analyst-Project)
Identified crime clusters with K-Modes clustering and built a classification model (decision tree, Naive Bayes, KNN, CatBoost) to predict crime types.

This machine learning project is the first one I completed for my university class

# [Project 2: EDA_Bank_Dataset](https://github.com/TongtaiM/EDA_Bank_Dataset)

This project explores customer variables in a bank dataset. By using data visualization and statistical analysis, I aim to understand customer characteristics and uncover valuable insights.

# [Project 3: Customer-Segmentation-for-Automobile-Company-Using-RFM-analysis](https://github.com/TongtaiM/Customer-Segmentation-for-Automobile-Company-Using-RFM-analysis)

This project aims to improve customer understanding and potentially increase revenue using a dataset from the Automobile industry. The dataset includes customer demographics and 2017 transaction data.

# [Project 4:Credit-Risk-German-Classification](https://github.com/TongtaiM/Credit-Risk-German-Classification-)

Predict good or bad credit risks with models that can deal with both numerical variables and categorical variables like CatBoost and XGBoost.
