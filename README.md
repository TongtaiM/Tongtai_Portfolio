### About me
I am a statistics student with a passion for data. To further my data expertise, I actively seek out learning opportunities beyond the classroom, such as data science bootcamp or online course. I integrate these learning with my university studies to unlock the potential of data and hone my skills through projects both inside and outside of the classroom.

I recently completed a data science bootcamp, and here are my notes 
[Data Science BootCamp Note](https://pinto-muskox-ee5.notion.site/Data-science-Boot-Camp-8d06e9dd4947495e801b96a3b3027c77?pvs=4)

# Project
## Project 1: Customer Response Analysis for Bank Marketing Campaign
[Customer Response Analysis for Bank Marketing Campaign](https://github.com/TongtaiM/EDA_Bank_Dataset)

This is my group project in my university class. We work with 45211 row and 17 column bank data.

- This project focuses on using EDA to increase the number of customers acquired through bank campaigns.
- We aim to uncover customer behavior trends by utilizing data visualization and statistics, ultimately optimizing marketing campaigns for customer acquisition.
- This project utilizes pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for data analysis.
#### Here are some insight we found

**We should target customers under 20 years old or over 60 years old.**

**If we can increase call duration, customers will have a better chance of joining our campaign.**

**We should target customers in normal and high acount group and.**
**Customer in bad acount group debt from a home loan.**

## Project 2: Customer-Segmentation-for-Automobile-Company-Using-RFM-analysis
[Customer-Segmentation-for-Automobile-Company-Using-RFM-analysis](https://github.com/TongtaiM/Customer-Segmentation-for-Automobile-Company-Using-RFM-analysis)

For this project, I am using an automobile company dataset that consists of four separate CSV files.
- This project focuses on segmenting customers into distinct groups to better understand and target customer needs.
- I conducted RFM analysis and segmentation using K-Means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and rule-based methods to compare result.
- I have create dashboard with power bi to visualize transactions patterns and customer demographics.
#### This is my dashboard

## Project 3: Crime-Analyst-Project
[Crime-Analyst-Project](https://github.com/TongtaiM/Crime-Analyst-Project)

This is for my final group project in my university. I was responsible for writing most of the code. We work with massive dataset containing 2 million crime cases in Los Angeles.

- This project harnesses the power of crime data to gain a deeper understanding of crime patterns in Los Angeles. By analyzing this data,   we developed prediction models to cope address crime issues.
- This dataset had many missing and some invalid columns, requiring extensive cleaning and preparation.
- We employed K-modes clustering in R and two-step clustering in SPSS to cluster crime cases and gain a deeper understanding of crime patterns.
- After clustering, we were able to group similar crime cases and create a new variable named "crime group".
- We test which independent variable are associate to crime group.
- Then we performed EDA on each crime group, uncovering valuable insights from each popular crime category.
- Unlike many crime prediction projects that focus on when and where crimes will occur, we took a different approach.
- We developed a classification model to predict which crime group will occur to victim.
- This project utilizes dplyr, ggplot2, and other machine learning library.

## Project 4: Credit-Risk-German-Classification
[Credit-Risk-German-Classification](https://github.com/TongtaiM/Credit-Risk-German-Classification-)

In this dataset, each entry represents a person who applies for credit from a bank. The data consists of 1,000 rows and 20 columns. Each person is classified as a good or bad credit risk.

- This project focuses on finding the best alogorithm to predict creditworthiness, optimizing for both accuracy and AUC score.
- I have tried to get the best results using feature engineering and random search for hyperparameters.

## Project 5: Predict Handwriting Numbers
[Credit-Risk-German-Classification](https://github.com/TongtaiM/Credit-Risk-German-Classification-)

- This project focuses on using the MNIST dataset to train a CNN model and tune parameters to achieve optimal performance on both the test dataset and imported real handwriting.
- I created a new function to crop images from real handwriting to make them resemble MNIST images.
