### About me
I am a statistics student with a passion for data. To further my data expertise, I actively seek out learning opportunities beyond the classroom, such as data science bootcamp or online course. I integrate these learning with my university studies to unlock the potential of data and hone my skills through projects both inside and outside of the classroom.

I recently completed a data science bootcamp, and here are my notes Notion
[Data science BootCamp Note](https://pinto-muskox-ee5.notion.site/Data-science-Boot-Camp-8d06e9dd4947495e801b96a3b3027c77?pvs=4)

# Project
## Project 1: Customer Response Analysis for Bank Marketing Campaign
[Customer Response Analysis for Bank Marketing Campaign](https://github.com/TongtaiM/EDA_Bank_Dataset)

This is my group project in my university class. We work with 45211 row and 17 column bank data

- This project focuses on using EDA to increase the number of customers acquired through bank campaigns
- We aim to uncover customer behavior trends by utilizing data visualization and statistics, ultimately optimizing marketing campaigns for customer acquisition.
- This project utilizes pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for data analysis.
#### Here is some insight we found

**We should target customers under 20 years old or over 60 years old.**

**If we can increase call duration, customers will have a better chance of joining our campaign.**

## Project 2: Customer-Segmentation-for-Automobile-Company-Using-RFM-analysis
[Customer-Segmentation-for-Automobile-Company-Using-RFM-analysis](https://github.com/TongtaiM/Customer-Segmentation-for-Automobile-Company-Using-RFM-analysis)

In this project i work with 200

- This project focuses on segmental customer to be able to deal with customers in groups
- I conducted RFM analysis and segmentation using K-Means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and rule-based methods to compare result
- I have create dashboard with power bi to visualize transactions patterns and customer demographics.

## Project 3: Crime-Analyst-Project
[Crime-Analyst-Project](https://github.com/TongtaiM/Crime-Analyst-Project)

Identified crime clusters with K-Modes clustering and built a classification model (decision tree, Naive Bayes, KNN, CatBoost) to predict crime types.

This machine learning project is the first one I completed for my university class


## Project 4:Credit-Risk-German-Classification
[Credit-Risk-German-Classification](https://github.com/TongtaiM/Credit-Risk-German-Classification-)

Predict good or bad credit risks with models that can deal with both numerical variables and categorical variables like CatBoost and XGBoost.
